# EXPENSE TRACKER CODE CHALLENGE

## Description
A code challenge on implementing React JS best practices by creating a simple expense tracker.

A user can:
- View all their expenses.
- Add any new expense.
- Filter any expenses by category.
- Delete any expense.

## Best Practices implemented:
- Form validation using Zod, React Hook Form and Hookform Resolvers.
- Modularization of code and keeping each component pure. Given different props, each component would still do the same thing.
- The component where a state was defined must be the one to change state. State is never changed from any other component.
- Exporting relevant constants from JS modules.

## Technologies:
- ReactJs
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
